# TaffyShield

This mod applies a "shield" when you first login or re-spawn. By default the shield goes away shortly after moving. 


There are some configs on when the shield applies, and if it stays on or off, and timing. 

There are also commands to enable/disable a player's shield, or add a temporary one (which will be removed when they move) 

Commands are started with: /taffy shield

 

Please note:

1. The timing is on a flat tick rate on the server side, aka its player independent. Increasing the time should give you a greater delay before the shield turns off, at least on average. That said, it could trigger right away after moving depending on your luck. 

2. There are ways that this can be abused. This really should only be used for casual play.
